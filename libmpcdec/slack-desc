# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libmpcdec: libmpcdec (Portable Musepack decoder library)
libmpcdec:
libmpcdec: Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on
libmpcdec: high quality. It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency,
libmpcdec: so that you won't be able to hear differences between the original
libmpcdec: wave file and the much smaller MPC file. It is based on the MPEG-1
libmpcdec: Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but has rapidly developed and vastly
libmpcdec: improved and is now at an advanced stage in which it contains heavily
libmpcdec: optimized and patentless code.
